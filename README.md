health app likely focuses on tracking and monitoring various health-related metrics. With the use of APIs and dummy data, you've set up placeholders for real-world data integration, which could be connected to external services or databases in the future.
**Key Features You Could Implement:**
**User Authentication:**
Login/Signup using Firebase, custom backend, or OAuth-based API (Google, Facebook).
Secure user data with encryption and token-based authentication.

**Personalized Health Dashboard:**
Dashboard UI displaying graphs, statistics, and insights on the user's health data (steps walked, heart rate, etc.).
Use APIs to fetch health reports or suggestions (e.g., recommended calorie intake, workout routines)
**Dummy Data:**
Placeholder health data such as mock step counts, exercise time, or heart rate readings to demonstrate app functionality.
Can easily be replaced with real-time data when connected to an actual API.
**API Integration:**
Use APIs to fetch health tips, diet recommendations, or workout routines.
Can be linked to public APIs or private health services for deeper insights.
